# Project TODO

This file tracks development tasks for this project.
I will update this list as we add, complete, or remove work.

## Active
- [ ] Enforce family-group-scoped in-law indicator (save-time + integrity repair)
  Priority: High
  Est date: 2026-03-07
  Desc: Implement `in_law` as family-group scoped (not global) so one person can be in-law in one family group but not another. On every relationship/household save, reconcile in-law status per affected person in the active family group: if person has spouse link in this family group and no parent edges in this family group, set/create `in_law=TRUE` with `share_scope=one_family` and `share_family_group_key=<familyGroupKey>`; if parent edges exist, clear/remove in-law marker for this family group only. Add integrity checker action to backfill/fix existing drift in bulk with before/after counts. Include migration/cleanup logic to prevent legacy global `in_law` markers from overriding family-scoped behavior.
- [ ] AI summary of person profile
  Priority: Med
  Est date: 2026-03-10
  Desc: Generate an AI-written summary for each person using profile fields, relationships, notes, and key dates with admin review before publish.
- [ ] AI game generation with point system
  Priority: Med
  Est date: 2026-03-14
  Desc: Generate replayable AI-driven family games and score rules, including points, streaks, and leaderboard tracking.
- [ ] Import related contacts when creating/migrating a family group
  Priority: Med
  Est date: 2026-03-21
  Desc: Add relationship-aware import rules so selected members bring related contacts into the target group automatically; 3rd gen child import includes parents, and 2nd gen import includes spouse plus in-law children.
- [ ] Develop Add Contact screen
  Priority: Med
  Est date: 2026-03-24
  Desc: Build a dedicated Add Contact flow with required fields, validation, and family-group association.
- [ ] Develop Contact attributes
  Priority: Med
  Est date: 2026-03-26
  Desc: Define and implement contact-level attributes and editing workflow.
- [ ] Develop Household attributes
  Priority: Med
  Est date: 2026-03-27
  Desc: Define and implement household-level attributes and editing workflow.
- [ ] Add primary contact attributes (phone, email, address)
  Priority: Med
  Est date: 2026-03-30
  Desc: Implement primary attribute flags and UI behavior for phone, email, and address so one value can be designated as primary per type.
- [ ] Develop user invitation flow with launch icon support
  Priority: Med
  Est date: 2026-04-05
  Desc: Add invitation workflow (email-based) and support install/launch icon guidance for invited users.
- [ ] Evaluate value/necessity of Viewer PIN function
  Priority: Med
  Est date: 2026-04-06
  Desc: Review whether Viewer PIN unlock is needed for this product phase, including UX complexity, security value, and whether to keep, simplify, or remove.
